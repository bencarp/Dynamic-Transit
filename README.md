# Dynamic-Transit
A small webapp for use in public transit: Made for reporting problems and other feedback to the Transit authority

The focus of this app lies in the easy usability: While it wouldn't be a problem to add more features, it would likely
make the app less fast and easily usable. 

Planned additional features:

  - QR-Code Scanner, cooperation with a Transit Authority for QR-tests in buses and trams
  - User Interface for the people working at the Transit Authority for visualizing the data raised in the app.
  
  - others following...
